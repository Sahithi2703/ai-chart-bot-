AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot for PluginHive is an advanced AI-driven solution designed to provide instant and accurate responses to customer queries.
This AI-driven chatbot automates PluginHiveâ€™s customer support by providing instant, accurate responses to user queries. It combines GPT4All (Mistral 7B) for natural language understanding with FAISS (vector database) to efficiently retrieve relevant FAQs. By eliminating the need for external APIs, it runs offline, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution.

When a user asks a question, the chatbot searches FAISS for relevant PluginHive FAQs and feeds the results to GPT4All, which generates a human-like response. Unlike traditional rule-based bots, it provides intelligent, context-aware answers in real time. The chatbot can also be deployed as a web app using Streamlit, making it accessible and user-friendly.

This project enhances customer experience, reduces support costs, and demonstrates AI-powered automation. Future improvements could include multilingual support, chat memory, and advanced search capabilities
